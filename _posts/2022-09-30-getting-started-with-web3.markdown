Hey Readers,

Thanks for checking in.

For a long time, I have been planning to get started with Web3 security as I feel this is the most exciting domain that we are about to witness in the next generation of information security.

I am planning to mention the notes and resources here so that they might help others who are willing to get started in this domain.

This is my first blog about Web3, so please find the below resources that will give you an overview of what the Web3 learning curve might look like. I will go into detail on most of the topics (that I feel are worth mentioning here) as I get the chance.

So, let's get started with a book called `Mastering Ethereum`. The following section would cover the following important notes about the same book: 

# Day 1 of Mastering Ethereum
## Chapter 1: What is Ethereum?

Ethereum is an open source, globally decentral‐ized computing infrastructure that executes programs called smart contracts. It uses a blockchain to synchronize and store the system’s state changes, along with a crypto‐currency called ether to meter and constrain execution resource costs.
